The biryani had ample of chicken pieces and quantity was good. Also tried the chilly chicken which was really good and is a try out for once!

Though they did not serve either gravy or raita with biryani but accepted the mistake when we raised the concern. However as we did not need either of those so we called it out after finishing the food. The restaurant is bit on higher side of price compared to the portion of food and the taste combined.

We ordered the mushroom tarts which were literally heaven on earth. And then the cottage cheese kababs with hummus and pita bread and the mushroom and truffle oil pizza. Both were really delicious and had the right amount of spice. The presentations were brilliant. For dessert we had the chocolate fondant which was amaaaaaazing. I still am tasting it in my mouth. We had virgin sangrias too which were okayish.

We ordered Cheesy Bacon Bombs- wouldn't suggest them to who are calorie conscious its deep fried and filled with cheese. The taste was just about ok. Rosemary Paneer Tikka is another choice that is decent as well. Indian version would be called Bacon Pakoda.  Dhaba Daal Tadka is nice and calming- very Indian and a good quantity for 1 person. Murg Kurchan with white rice is spicy and tangy so it's nice. With Zomato gold being with everyone this place is value for money. A good visit for a group of friends\n",

This restaurant has a wide variety of food on the menu. The list is extremely long of the items you could order and I don't think any of them disappoints. The beef fry is delicious but something you shouldn't miss out on is the fish and chips. The appam and stew will also leave your mouth watering. This is a perfect place to visit for breakfast lunch or dinner.\\nThe servers here are as old as the restaurant. The restaurant has stood the test of time and so have they.

It was very difficult to comprehend what we were eating as most of the things seemed to be repeated and made in the same marination. The mocktails were aesthetic but not upto the mark as per our expectations.

      " went here with my best buddies. But nothing to take away from the place.\\nThe whole gastrobar has a great vibe to it with openness of the entire seating and karaoke on the side. The staff is really warm and friendly. The cheese samosas and potato jackets were great appetizers. The pizza was good too. The highlight of the whole evening was an extremely potent LIIT though ;)\\nThe crowd too was lively adding to the entire experience. Overall a must visit place.\"\")\n",
